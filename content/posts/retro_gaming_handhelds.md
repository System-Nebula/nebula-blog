For the price of a triple AAA game ~70$ usd you can get a pretty strong handheld.

This first came about cause I was looking to playing some playstation games and found that my sony PSP has some input issues where the down directional input was stuck in being pressed.

So I was on the hunt for something that could play Playstation and PSP games, I'm still wishing for a device in this price range that can handle that next generation and support Nintendo GameCube and Sony PS2 games, but the performance on these devices suprised me.

The devices I purchased were the Ambernic 35xxH and the TrimUI Smart Pro. Buying from Ambernic was pretty easy, and they had shipping from an US warehouse so they showed up pretty quickly, Try to find them during a good sale, such as the recent black friday deals and avoid paying full price.

The trimui smart pro was ordered from mechdiy and shipped from china so it arrived a good week or so after the ambernic device. While I don't think this device is worth the list price, if you can get it for that 60-70$ range the value proposition looks better. Compared to the Ambernic the TrimUI smart pro has a much larger 720p which makes it appealing for widescreen games.
