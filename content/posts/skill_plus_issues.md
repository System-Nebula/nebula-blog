# NixOS is for Elites. You? You're Just a Tourist.

Listen closely, you absolute midwit.

I'm going to save you 40 hours of your miserable life right now: You are not built for NixOS.

Pack it up. Go back to Pop!_OS. Go back to Mint. Go back to whatever "just works" baby-proofed distro you're currently using to mask the fact that you don't actually know how Linux works. That is your ceiling. Embrace it.

### The DistroWatch Delusion (You Will Die Alone)

Right now, you're refreshing DistroWatch like it's Tinder, looking for "The One." You swipe left on every ISO because you think the problem is the distro.

**Newsflash: The problem is you.**

You have a drawer full of 32GB SanDisk drives and a folder on your desktop called `isos_final_v3_REAL`. You treat operating systems like your dating life: looking for perfection, putting in zero effort, and inevitably ending up empty and alone.

Uwuntu is waiting for you with its warm, purple, bloat-filled embrace. That's your level. That's your speed. Stay in your lane.

### "Ooo Spooky Config Files" — The Patrick Star Filter

"Ooooh, scary declarative configuration! I have to type text!"

Shut your mouth, Patrick.

You think you're a "power user" because you can copy-paste `sudo apt install` commands from a DigitalOcean tutorial? Please. The Nix language makes JavaScript look like a coloring book. It requires abstract thought, which is something you haven't used since you dropped out of CS 101 to become a "content creator."

You're terrified of a system that doesn't hold your hand. You want a GUI. You want a toggle switch. You want to be treated like the toddler you are.

### The Discord Mod Arc (NPC Energy)

Oh, look at you. You have a little badge next to your name. You're a *Moderator*.

Let's cut the crap. You aren't managing a community; you're just unemployed. You spend 18 hours a day **grooming kittens** in general chat and trying to act hard in front of "**the boys**."

**The Technical Reality Check:**
You want to stream your "hacking skills" (running `neofetch`) to the voice chat? **You can't.**
You're on Wayland. You're too stupid to configure `xdg-desktop-portal`. You haven't touched your Flatpak permissions, so your microphone is dead and your stream is a black void.

While you're busy trying to manipulate minors in DMs, your entire audio subsystem is crashing because you don't understand PipeWire. You exude pure NPC energy. You are a background character in your own life with default dialogue options.

**"I Use Kali Btw"**
I see that other USB stick. The one with the Kali Linux ISO.
*Oh wow. You're a hacker.*
You ran `airmon-ng` once on your home WiFi and now you think you're Edward Snowden.
"I'm anonymous," you whisper, while posting on Reddit with the same username you use for your Steam account.
You are a script kiddie. A skid. You download tools you don't understand to impress people who don't care.

Go back to your Kali live boot. You'll never get caught using that... mostly because you can't figure out how to connect it to the internet.

### NVIDIA = Mom's Basement Eternal

Oh, you have an NVIDIA card? Let me guess — you need it for "gaming" while you're rotting in your mom's basement at 28.

**SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE FORTNITE, CHILD.**

What's that? You want to play Valorant? The Chinese kernel spyware?

That's cool. You literally wiped Windows to "protect your privacy," installed the most complex Linux distro on earth, and now you're crying because you can't inject Tencent's rootkit into your kernel to click heads?

**Make it make sense.**

Here is your pathetic lifecycle:

1. **Update System:** NVIDIA driver build fails (See Issue #489947).
2. **Panic:** You don't read the logs. You don't check the overlay. You hyperventilate.
3. **Rage:** You blame the distro maintainers because you're too incompetent to understand kernel patching.
4. **The Walk of Shame:** You reboot into your Windows dual-boot to play your spyware shooter like the little traitor you are.

You bought the worst GPU for Linux to play children's games, and now you're shocked that open-source developers don't prioritize your proprietary nonsense.

Enjoy your kernel panic, gamer. You earned it.

### You Can't Even Handle Flatpak

Let's be real: You struggle with Flatpak permissions. You are out here Googling "how to enable microphone discord flatpak" like a peasant.

If you can't handle a sandbox permission, what makes you think you're ready for Flakes? Overlays? Home Manager? The gap between you and a functional NixOS user is wider than the gap between you and a gym membership.

### The Unixporn Gooner & The "900-Year-Old" Excuse

Oh, I see you posted your "rice" on Reddit.

Let's analyze this setup. You have a tiling window manager (Hyprland, because you follow trends), a terminal with 40% transparency, and a wallpaper of a cartoon child in a bikini.

**"Uhm, actually, she's a 900-year-old vampire princess,"** you type furiously, wiping Cheeto dust on your mechanical keyboard. **"Stop slandering my waifu!"**

Shut the hell up. You aren't a "man of culture." You are a degenerate on a watchlist.

And the funniest part? **You didn't even build this system.**

I know exactly what you did.

1. You saw a top post on r/unixporn.
2. You went to the GitHub repo.
3. You clicked the green **"Code > Download ZIP"** button.
4. You right-clicked and selected **"Extract with WinRAR"** because you're still dual-booting like a coward.

**LMAO.**

You're on a Linux subreddit. Posting your "rice." And you extracted it with WinRAR. On Windows. Let that sink in.

You literally downloaded a `.zip` of someone else's Nix flake, extracted it into `~/.config`, and now you're crying in their GitHub Issues tab: *"Bro how do I install? `nixos-rebuild` says command not found? Pls fix."*

You can't unzip skill, you absolute creep.

You're trying to run a complex, modular Home Manager configuration by copy-pasting files you can't read, all to display an anime girl you shouldn't be looking at.

NixOS is reproducible. Your ability to talk to women is not.

### NixOS is a Feral Teenager (And You're Not Man Enough)

NixOS is like a teenager on Adderall. It isn't going to clean up its room. You have to tell it to.

You have to run `nix-collect-garbage -d`. You have to manage the generations. You have to be the adult. 

But you? You're not man enough to take ownership. You hoard 400GB of build artifacts because you're afraid to delete anything, just like you hoard Steam games you'll never play. You want NixOS to parent itself while you sit there paralyzed, unable to make a decision.

### The Disappointed Dad

I look at your screen. I see that default Uwuntu purple / GNOME setup.

I'm not mad. I'm just... disappointed.

Actually, that's a lie. I'm disgusted. You had the potential to learn. You had the chance to touch the divine light of reproducible builds. But you chose mediocrity. You chose the path of least resistance.

You're no son of mine.

### Reverse Psychology? No, Just Facts.

You can't do this, MF.

You'll never be a NixOS user. You don't have the tism. You don't have the patience. You lack the sheer will required to debug a cryptic eval error at 3 AM.

You know, something like this:

```
error:
       … while calling the 'head' builtin

         at /nix/store/rgn0yj6h0n6vxzlzxyw856y11vgps9f0-nixos/nixos/lib/attrsets.nix:850:11:

          849|         || pred here (elemAt values 1) (head values) then
          850|           head values
             |           ^
          851|         else

       … while evaluating the attribute 'value'

         at /nix/store/rgn0yj6h0n6vxzlzxyw856y11vgps9f0-nixos/nixos/lib/modules.nix:807:9:

          806|     in warnDeprecation opt //
          807|       { value = builtins.addErrorContext "while evaluating the option `${showOption loc}':" value;
             |         ^
          808|         inherit (res.defsFinal') highestPrio;

       (stack trace truncated; use '--show-trace' to show the full trace)

       error: value is a function while a set was expected
```

Seeing this at 3 AM gotta suck, huh? You're going to stare at "value is a function while a set was expected" until your eyes bleed, then rage-quit back to Uwuntu where errors actually make sense.

...You're still reading?

Maybe—just maybe—that sudden spike of rage you feel is a sign of life. Maybe being told you're too stupid is the only thing that actually motivates your defiance-based personality.

So go ahead. Prove me wrong, you pathetic little normie.

Install it. Break it. Cry. Read the Wiki. Fix it.

But when your NVIDIA card inevitably shits the bed mid-boot, just remember: I warned you.

**PS:** We like NixOS in this house. You? The jury is out, and they are laughing at you.
